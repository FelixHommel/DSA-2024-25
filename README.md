## P1 - P6
missing because I lost them on my old PC

## P7
P7 is about finding the most cost efficient way of connecting treehouses with each other.
It is utilizing Minimum spanning trees with Kursskal's algorithm and a Union-Find Data Structure.

For a sample input:

1\
5 7\
1 2 4\
3 1 1\
2 3 2\
1 4 2\
4 3 2\
2 4 3\
1 5 5

the expected result is 10

## P8
P8 is about finding the furthest away treehouse from a starting point.
It is utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to all other
points. After that the longest of these can easily be found.

For a sample input:

1\
4 5\
1 2 2\
2 4 5\
3 4 3\
3 2 1\
1 3 7

the expected output is 6
